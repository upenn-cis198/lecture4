# Lecture 4: Lifetimes, Structs, and Enums

(Due to time constraints, this lecture spans 2 class periods.)

## Classroom minutiae 2021-02-18

HW2 now available, due in 2 weeks: [here](https://github.com/upenn-cis198/homework2).

- Remember to email **before** the deadline to use late days (either the 4 freebies or additional late days) -- so that we make sure to delay grading your assignment.

Some pain points from HW1:

- Make sure to run `cargo clippy` (handling all warnings) and `cargo fmt`!

- Part 3 problem 4: `&'static str` lifetime

- Part 3 problem 7: passing ownership vs. passing references
