/*
    Topic 1 for today: Lifetimes
*/

/*
    Recall the following from last class period:

    - Ownership: Each object should have exactly one
      one owner; memory is dropped when the owner leaves scope

    - Borrowing: When you "borrow" ownership, you get either
      read-only access (any number of borrows) XOR read-write
      access (exactly one borrow) (note the XOR).

    This solves various problems related to memory safety, for example:
    - Memory leaks:
      solved by --> "memory is dropped when the owner leaves scope"
    - Null pointer dereference and pointers to bad memory
      solved by --> "Each object should have exactly one one owner"
          "memory is dropped when the owner leaves scope"
          ... but is it?

    LIFETIMES

    The problem with the above is that it doesn't allow me to ensure
    that references are always valid.

      // implicitly we are dropping s here.

    // If you understand this example, then you understand lifetimes!
    // assert_eq!(copy_string(&r, 3), "hellohellohello") // doesn't work
    // How does Rust know that r is not a valid reference here?

    // Answer: it will assign an implicit lifetime to each variable.
    // A "lifetime" is just an internal thing, in Rust denoted with
    //                    'a
    // or:                'b
    // or the special:    'static
    // What it means is "how long" the reference points to valid memory;
    // it's derived from the scope of the original owner.
